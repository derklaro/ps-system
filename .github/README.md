# Private Server System ![Build Status](https://github.com/derklaro/ps-system/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

This private server system is designed for very complex networks (maybe with their own cloud system). Because of the
**modular structure** the system is very flexible and has no need to load classes which are not required for the current
running environment.

## How to use
##### Download
You can Download the latest build from here: https://github.com/derklaro/ps-system/actions

##### Lobby config

To use the system you have to upload the plugin core to your Lobby server's plugin folder. Then create a new folder
called `plugins/ps/modules` and upload the lobby as well as the cloud module to this folder.

The following cloud systems are supported:

- [CloudNET V2.1.17](https://github.com/CloudNetService/CloudNet) using the module ps-cloudnet2-legacy.
- [CloudNET V2.2+](https://github.com/CloudNetService/CloudNet/tree/development) using the module ps-cloudnet2.
- [CloudNET V3.4+](https://github.com/CloudNetService/CloudNet-v3) using the module ps-cloudnet3.

Then create a new

- Task (if you are using cloudnet 3)
- ServerGroup (if you are using cloudnet 2)

and restart the lobby server. Now there should be configuration file called `config.json` in the
`plugins/ps/modules/lobby` folder. Open this file and configure the options you see. Set `ps-group-name` to the just
created group name.

##### Private server group/task config

Upload the system and cloud module as mentioned above. Then put the runner into the modules folder as well.

**Now you are ready to go!**
